# Communication

The community abides by the [code of conduct] on all of
communication platforms that we moderate listed below with noted exceptions.

Here is an excerpt from the code of conduct:

> _As contributors and maintainers of this project, and in the interest
> of fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect
> all people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature
> requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches,
> and other activities._


### Appropriate Content for Community Resources

All communications properties are under the [code of conduct].
Additionally, these resources are for the contributors and users; commercial usage of these properties is heavily moderated.
Note that commercial content is allowed, unsolicited commercial content mostly is NOT:

Examples of inappropriate content:
- Posting unsolicited content of a commercial nature on Discord or other community forums
- Messaging people individually on a platform with content of an unsolicited commercial nature
- Unsolicited pitching of commercial products during a meeting

We talk a lot, too.
